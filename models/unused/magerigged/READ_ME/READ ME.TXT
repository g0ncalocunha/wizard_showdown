Once you open up blend file
open a new text window (Text Editor), after you opened "text editor window" press open and find the "rigui.py" file
found in this same folder after you opened it press play on the right side of the button "open"

To save the custom ui so you dont have to do this every time you open up a file in same "text editor" there is a drop down
menu once you press "text" witch is to the left of the "play button" in that drop down you have to check button "REGISTER"

!!!!!!(You will find pitcures for everything below this text file)!!!!!

that will give you the CUSTOM UI witch contains all control layers 
(to enable/disable bone names go to armature tab "viewport display" and check or uncheck names box)

to apply texture go to shading tab add material (shift + a) type image click on image texture click open locate "56x56texture.png" connect to base color and your good to go
